The day before my birthday and the new year marked 100 days free from cannabis. It’s the longest I’ve gone without consuming since age 15 or 16. I tried to moderate for years, long after I knew I was an addict. In 2019 I attended a Marijuana Anonymous meeting in San Jose, California. I was working a challenging internship and struggling with anxiety, loneliness, frustration, and self-loathing. I knew the deals I would make with myself- “I’ll only smoke on weekends, I won’t buy, only one bowl a night”- were false. No matter what I promised, I would still think about scoring and smoking. At work, when I was trying to focus, my thoughts drifted to getting high. On my morning runs, I’d think about pot. I would devise new plans for how to “healthily” consume. It was an obsession that stole not only the hours after I’d inhaled the smoke or vapor, but most of my waking time. 

I journaled intermittently from early adolescence but my entries were not regular or cogent enough to follow until fall 2019. I had been so unhappy at my internship even though I was succeeding at the status game. I needed to change to be content and comfortable with myself. I decided to take the rest of the semester off and spend a month kiteboarding in La Ventana, Baja California. Kiteboarding is a great joy to me and during that trip, I was happier than I had been since my last relationship. Around this time I started my first serious diary and was counting days sober from pot. I relapsed while in Mexico, but got back on the wagon and kept going. 

When I got back to school for my last semester in spring 2020 I was again really unhappy. I felt that I had wasted my college years smoking and drinking, trying to get my anxious brain to feel like I fit in a place where I didn’t. I was committed to abstinence from pot, counting days and planning to hit 100 before a spring break ski trip to Colorado. But I gave in, lacking the willpower to stand firm through an acute bout of panic attacks and depression. I believe it was around this time that I learned not to beat myself up for failing. I was so low already that self-hatred and perfectionism were not an option. I was truly desperate. I prayed to God to take away the terrible pain I was feeling, something I was not raised to nor had turned to before. 

He answered my prayers and my deep depression with persistent suicidal thoughts was lifted. That experience of Grace grew my tiny seed of faith into a small green shoot issuing forth. God soothed my pain and took away the horrible desire to end my life. I still struggle with anxiety and depression but now I know that there is a God who loves me. He loves me through Christ, other people, and Creation. There is a force bigger than all of us, bigger than matter. There is a reason why the whole world and each of us individually exists. 

I experienced a gradual awakening and changed in many ways. However, I was still an addict suffering from a biological-psychological-spiritual ailment. I chose to ignore the fact that using was a tax on my physical, mental, and spiritual health. Even after having declared myself as an addict to others and recording attempts to stay sober, I claimed I could moderate again. 

There was another period of more than a year, like many before in high school and college, of consuming cannabis as it actively worsened my mental health. I lied to myself and those that love me that I was fine because I was mostly functioning in my job and relationships. I would get a bag, consume once a day, then several times a day, then ration to several times a week or weekends as I started to worry about running out. All addicts understand this process. I learned from the MA Life with Hope book and other recovery resources that the craving-withdrawal-relapse process strengthens the addiction each time it is repeated.

I’m not sure exactly what separated my final quit date from the dozens of other attempts. I had been avoiding “picking up” and only smoking other people’s drugs for a while before then. Until I had been drinking and someone mentioned pot, when I then asked for his hookup, bought, binged, and flushed the rest of the bag. I had grown more honest with myself and could admit how destructive this cycle was. The key is that I no longer labeled myself as a horrible and worthless person. I saw that it was a choice I was making and had the option to stop. I could refuse the urges to procure or use drugs, and I would no longer be a self-destructive, stupid, selfish user. 

God blessed me with an environment free from strong temptations in early recovery. I checked in online meetings daily, chatting with others also experiencing withdrawal. I read Life with Hope and online recovery stories. 

The thoughts about acquiring and consuming the drug started to decrease. The fantasies of someday using like a normal person someday became less frequent. When I was again exposed to pot, I let myself feel the urge and let it pass. For many years, I would have stolen it, gotten high, felt guilty and anxious, and hated myself for being an addict and thief. Once my number of days got past milestones, it was a tangible impediment to not relapsing. 

My name is Natalie and I’m a marijuana addict. I always will be. I recognize fellowship with other cannabis addicts and all addicts. I think that many of us who ran into trouble with Mary Jane are introverts, deep feelers, and thinkers already inclined to have their heads in the clouds. We fell into the trap of trying to live in a private world, when we’re supposed to be in the big, real, shared one and connect to God and other people. 

I believe there are addicts and non-addicts in general and for specific substances. At the same time, I think that addiction is a deep human antipattern that has a shared thread with many negative behaviors. My understanding of the Bible and other sources of wisdom’s concept of Sin includes addiction, coveting things, and using people like objects. I don’t believe that hatred of self or others is an effective response to Sin. It didn’t help me kick my drug addiction and it doesn’t for most. Self-compassion, absolute respect for the person as a Self and a child of God, while honestly recognizing destructive and Wrong choices, is the approach that helped me and millions of others. 

Recovery taught me that anything we think we need, other than God’s love and the love He designed for us of family and friends, can to be a stumbling block to peace. The most important pursuit I now engage in is to stop pursuing. I can just exist, without doing anything, analyzing the past, or planning for the future. I can choose peace.
